# web-starter-template

A simple template for a monorepo web app. It's just a little shortcut for me, and maybe you.

- Server: Node, Express, Sequelize
- Client: Vue.js, Tailwind
- Plus a root folder with `concurrently` to run both at once with `npm start`

### Getting Started

> **Before copying this and pasting it into your terminal**, make sure you've handled your terminal's pasting behavior. Execution on paste because of a newline can be an attack vector. Changing your terminal's pasting behavior to strip out newlines is a good idea. At this time I'd like to highlight that I am not your father or lawyer. We both know you can do whatever you want. This is just a suggestion.
